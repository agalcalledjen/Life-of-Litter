**[Hacking for Humanity](https://gitvan2019.devpost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)** was a 2-day code-a-thon where participants, entrepreneurs, educators, and mentors worked together to build apps that solve social problems.

> **2019 Challenge Statement** How might we use technology to educate and connect people to the natural world?

## Inspiration

We wanted everyone to know exactly where things go when they are thrown away, and how to make the earch a cleaner place by recycling. 
- What's the benefit of recycling? 
- How long do things sit in a landfill before decomposing? 

## Setup

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```
#### Run
```bash
npm start
```

## Gameplay

Sign up or log in to play the game.
1. Start the game by choosing a litter character, and follow it through its life cycle.
2. Choose which bin it goes into and learn what happens to it:
    - Trash 
    - Compost
    - Recycling
3. Unlock new litter characters by selecting the correct path.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Material UI
- Sketch (Litter Characters)

## Personal Learnings

Our group learned a lot about the life cycle of litter. It was surprisingly difficult to find out where different types of litter goes. Having one place to access all of the info will help educate people on how to recycle properly, and have fun doing it!
